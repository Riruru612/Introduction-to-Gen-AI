# Cat Species Generation & Classification

## Overview
This project demonstrates:
1. Synthetic image generation using Stable Diffusion
2. Inference-only image classification using a pre-trained ResNet model

## Files
- dataset_generation.ipynb: Generates synthetic cat species images
- resnet_inference_accuracy.ipynb: Performs ResNet inference and accuracy calculation

## Model Details
- Generative Model: Stable Diffusion (Hugging Face)
- Classification Model: ResNet-18 (ImageNet pre-trained)

## Note
ResNet was not fine-tuned on cat species. Accuracy is computed using semantic matching.
